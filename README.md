# Self_Checkout_System
 This is a project that I (alongside a group of 12 others) have worked on for an introductory software engineering course.
 We used Java and Java Swing to create this project. 
 
 The hardware code was written by the professsor of this course, while the software logic 
 that makes use of the hardware and the testing of the software logic was written by 
 myself and my group members. 
 
 Also included are diagrams of the application (eg. structural and state diagrams) via diagrams.pdf
