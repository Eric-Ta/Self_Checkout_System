# IntroToSoftwareEngineering Group Project
 A school group project that i have worked on for an introductory software engineering course. 
 
 The hardware code was written by the professsor of this course, while the software logic 
 that makes use of the hardware and the testing of the software logic was written by 
 myself and my group members.
